<!-- Brief Dazzle
I love teaching! I've learned that it's the most effective way to solidify your knowledge and leave
little to no gaps. Dazzle is the collection of my articles teaching a subject in depth. It delves
into topics such as rendering, mathematics, guidelines and more. It's just my way of giving back to
the community!
